         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Among the troops of thoſe zealous Votaries, ſome (diſeaſed with the itch of curioſity) were very importunate to ſee the ſaid relick ſo famouſly ſpoken of abroad in the world, &amp; were willing to purchaſe the ſame at a very conſiderable rate. This relique being depolited in the hands of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he reverend Father the keeper therof, upon a certain day appointed for that purpoſe, he came to give them a Viſion of it; and cauſing them to ſtand at a convenient diſtance from it, having prepared and raiſed up the devotion of their minds, with much gravity of ſpeech, at laſt with very low genu-flections once and again, and the third time alſo, with all reverence he took off one mantle, and then (with the like ceremony) he took off another; and another, until he came to the very laſt, which was of very rich ſcarlet. When he came to that, he required them with all ſerious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion of mind, and thought, to gather up all their viſive faculties; and to look ſtedfaſtly, and fixedly upon the ſaid Relique, when he ſhould unfold that laſt mantle, which he ſaid he was to do and to ſold it up again, with all holy celerity and expedition; and having moſt nimbly opened the ſaid mantle, and with the like ſpeed folded it up again, he demanded whether they did not ſee it. Some held their peace, others ſaid they faw nothing. How? (ſaid the Prieſt,) what, ſaw you nothing? did you ſhut your eyes? are you wilfully blind? Pray Sir, ſaid ſome of them (having a little more courage then the reſt) pardon us; but tel us what it was, What it was (ſaid the prieſt?) I am ſorry that you have eyes, and cannot ſee, or (which is worſe) you wil not ſee; but i'le tel you what it was; mary it is the breath of the <hi>Aſſe</hi> upon which Chriſt rode to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when the people cried <hi>Hoſanna</hi> unto him. At which they that were ſilent before, did profeſſe they ſaw it very plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wondered that the reſt did not ſee it; and ſo they departed very thankful, very much ſatisfied, and wel apaid at their bargain. In like manner Mr <hi>Lamb</hi> hath filled the eares of the World round about him vvith the mighty noiſe of the <hi>great truth of God</hi> concerning baptiſme on his ſide, that it is moſt apparently evident in his book, and by the light thereof, that the baptiſme of believers at age, in oppoſition to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant

But you will take upon you to cut off more than a third part thereof, without any commiſſion or authority from God, or from <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> for your inſtruction or voucher.

Yet undiſcipled perſons (at leaſt in your ſenſe undiſcipled) were circumciſed; Even ſo I conceive, though no <hi>nations</hi> of the Gentiles were to be baptized, but diſcipled <hi>nations,</hi> yet children, not actually, and with underſtanding, brought to the knowledg of Chriſt, may be baptized.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Suppoſe it be granted that none but <hi>diſcipled perſons</hi> are to be baptized, yet will it not follow that children muſt not be baptized? The reaſon is, becauſe in Scripture-ſenſe, children of <hi>diſcipled</hi> parents are called <hi>diſcipled</hi> perſons, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.10. <hi>VVhy do ye tempt God to put a yoak upon the neck of the Diſciples;
<note place="margin">Children are called Diſciples in Scripture.</note> &amp;c.</hi> This yoak is circumciſion; all are called Diſciples upon whom this yoak was put. Now this yoak was not put upon the neck of the believing Jews, in reſpect of their perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſubjection to circumciſion, for they were circumciſed already: but upon their children, or upon them, in reſpect of their children, who are here called Diſciples. Again <hi>Iohn</hi> 9.28. ſaid the Jews to the man whom Chriſt cured, being born blinde, <hi>we are Moſes Diſciples; we,</hi> that is, the whole Nation of us Jews, are <hi>Moſes Diſciples,</hi> under the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law. And you know that children were under <hi>Moſes</hi> his diſcipline in reſpect of circumciſion.</p>
               <p>Again, the Scripture calls children by the name of <hi>Gods ſervants, Lev.</hi> 25.41, 42. <hi>Then ſhall he depart from thee, both he and his children with him,</hi> (ſpeaking of the jewiſh ſervants and their children, when the year of Jubile comes) <hi>for</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>they are my ſervants, he and his children,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for they,</hi> that is, <hi>he and his children are my Servants:</hi> If <hi>children</hi> may be called <hi>Moſes Diſciples,</hi> and <hi>Gods Servants</hi> under the Law, why may they not be reputed Chriſts <hi>Diſciples</hi> and his <hi>Servants</hi> under the Goſpel?</p>
               <p>Again the holy actions of Parents are ſaid to be done alſo by their children, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.4. <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> proclaimed a faſt, <hi>and Iudah ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered themſelves together to ask,</hi> or pray for <hi>help of the Lord:</hi> Who are meant by <hi>Judah?</hi> See verſe the 13th. <hi>And all Iudah ſtood before the Lord with their little ones, their wives, and their children;</hi> thus children are ſaid to pray with their fathers. Again <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11. <hi>Ye ſtand this day all of you before the Lord your God, your captains of your Tribes, your El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and your Officers, with all the men of Iſrael, your little ones, your wives,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that thou ſhouldeſt enter into covenant with the Lord thy</hi> God, <hi>and into his Oath,</hi> &amp;c. Thus children are ſaid to Faſt, to Pray, to Repent, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> in Gods mercifull acceptation, their Parents being exerciſed in thoſe duties. Why may they not be ſaid now alſo to be the ſame with their Parents? Again <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.9. <hi>David</hi> ſaith thus: <hi>Thou art he that tookeſt me out of the womb: thou did'ſt make me to hope when</hi> I <hi>was upon my Mothers Breaſts.</hi> What is more plain in Scripture than this, <hi>viz.</hi> in Gods gracious account children are ſaid to hope and depend upon him, even before they come to underſtand the Doctrine
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:192312:23"/>of hope. Again, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.5, 6. children are ſaid to <hi>believe</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and a fearfull judgement denounced againſt thoſe that ſhall do them inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And whether you do not wrong them by excluding them from the Ordinance of Baptiſm, it concerns you wel to conſider. See the like, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.36, 37. and 42. compared together. Again, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.13, 14, 15. Again <hi>Math.</hi> 19.13, 14, 15.

               <p n="4">4. In Sacrament all Ordinances,
<note place="margin">In Sacrament all Ordinances we muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Gods command, not to the fitneſs of the things ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thereby.</note> the inſtitutions and commands of God, are to be obſerved, more than the adaption of the <hi>ſign</hi> unto the thing <hi>ſignified</hi> according to our thoughts and apprehenſions. Such ceremonies under the Law were appointed by God, to be had in his worſhip, which (it is likely) mans wiſdom (had the matter been left unto him) had never choſen unto ſuch ends. If you had perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced us firſt, that <hi>dipping,</hi> and not <hi>ſprinckling,</hi> had been Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, in that adminiſtration, we had had nothing to ſay for our ſelves, why <hi>ſprinckling</hi> ſhould be uſed, when <hi>dipping</hi> is appointed; but to argue meetly from a conceited aptneſs,

                  </note> of the manner of Baptiſm in this way, and not in that, to repreſent the ſuppoſed ends thereof, is to juſtifie the Papiſts in their uſe of their ſignificant, and teaching ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, which God never appointed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The command being to baptize, and the manner thereof not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directed, there being in the Scriptures a various interpretation and uſe of the ſame word, wherein the command is given,
<note place="margin">The command of Christ to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, is of ſeveral interpretations.</note> and no one of theſe interpretations more than others inſiſted upon in that place where it is given, doubtleſs in ſuch caſes, the Churches and people of God, may uſe their liberty, in making choiſe of that, which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive moſt conducing to their ſpirituall, and temporall intereſt. And that being the true ſtate of the caſe in hand, therefore, as circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may be, he that baptizeth by dipping, <hi>may do wel,</hi> and he that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it by ſprinckling <hi>may do better.</hi> And ſo again on the contrary, as the caſe may be; he that baptizeth by ſprinckling, <hi>may do well,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">God doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſome Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall things to be done that are leſs ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant (as least in mans thoughts) than what he might have comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; but his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are the ground of our duty.</note> and he that doeth it by dipping, <hi>may do better.</hi> The worſhip of God under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, being more ſpirituall than under the Law; wherein God ſtandeth not ſo much upon the Letter, as upon the Spirit, and truth of the heart.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In Sacramentall Ordinances, God may, and (doubtleſs) doth make uſe of ſuch tipes and ceremonies, which may not ſo fully, and in all points of ſpirituall inſtructions (in mans apprehenſion) anſwer the things ſignified, as ſome other tipes and ceremonies would, which he doth not make uſe of, and that for very <hi>rich and ſpirituall ends,</hi> which would be too great a digreſſion to inſiſt upon. As for inſtance, in that Ordinance of the Supper, he might have made uſe, not onely of a meer piece of bread and a cup of wine, but alſo of a competent meal of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable proviſion, to have ſhewed forth his death and their life, by
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:192312:26"/>means thereof, with much more ſignification; as ſuppoſe it had been by the killing of ſome Lamb, or other living creature made for the uſe of man; and afterwards to have eaten it together in love, and holy mirth. This, a man would have thought, would have anſwered the <hi>rich and ſpirituall ends</hi> of that Ordinance better, than a ſmall bit of Bread, and a little Wine would do. If God ſaith go into the River <hi>Iordan,</hi> and waſh, and be clean, we muſt not ſuffer our hearts to mind the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Amana,</hi> and <hi>Pharpar,</hi> Rivers of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> but ſubmit unto his Ordinance, though it be never ſo mean in our eyes. Many times, the goodly and moſt likely Sons of <hi>Ieſſie,</hi> are rejected, and the contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lad ſought out and crown'd. Therefore it is no good Argument to conclude that ſprinckling in baptiſm cannot be of God, though it ſhould be granted that <hi>the Death, Buriall, and Reſurrection of Chriſt,</hi> are not ſo fitly repreſented by <hi>ſprinckling,</hi> as by <hi>dipping.</hi>

               <p n="7">7. AND laſtly, there is more aptneſs even in ſprinckling the ſubject of baptiſm by water, to the <hi>rich,</hi> holy, <hi>and ſpirituall ends</hi> of baptiſm,
<note place="margin">Spinckling doth fully anſwer the ends of baptiſm, yea better than dipping.</note> then perhaps hath entred into your minds, ſeriouſly to conſider; as for inſtance.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The ſprinckling of water doth more lively repreſent the <hi>effuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of Chriſts blood for us, and conſequently <hi>the death of Chriſt,</hi> than a ſtanding Pool, or River doth. It was not ſimply <hi>the blood</hi> of Chriſt, but the <hi>blood of Chriſt ſhed,</hi> by which we have a Redemption, and Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins. Now though water in a Pool, or River, might in a dull way repreſent the blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet the <hi>ſprinckling,</hi> or pouring of it out, doth more aptly ſet forth the <hi>ſhedding</hi> of this blood. We may well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that his precious blood did trickle down from his moſt ſacred Temples, Hands, Feet, and Sides, when he was upon the Croſs, all which (I ſay) is more ſignificantly repreſented by <hi>Sprinckling,</hi> than by <hi>Dipping.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. A little Water <hi>ſprinckled</hi> and poured out upon a perſon, doth more lively and ſignificantly ſet forth the <hi>value, worth, and excellency</hi> of <hi>Christs</hi> blood, than a great ſtanding Pool, Pond, or River, inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the beholders thereof, that it is not the <hi>quantity,</hi> but the <hi>quality,</hi> the <hi>dignity</hi> of <hi>Christs</hi> blood. Though it be but as the blood of a Lamb, yet the Lamb being ſpotleſs, and without blemiſh, that hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed redemption, and remiſſion of ſins, the Scriptures take no notice <hi>how much</hi> the blood was, but what the <hi>dignity</hi> of that blood was, that was ſhed, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. <hi>God hath purchaſed the church with his own blood. Heb.</hi> 9.14. It is <hi>the blood of Christ, who through the eternall Spirit offered himſelf without ſpot,</hi> &amp;c. that purgeth the conſcience, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. <hi>You are redeemed, not with ſilver and gold,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a Lamb without blemiſh, and without ſpot.</hi> It is true, a great Pool, Pond, or River, might better repreſent the blood of Bulls and Goats, Oxen and Heifers, Rams and Lambs, &amp;c. altogether, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:192312:26"/>a great Pool, or lake of blood which is corrupted, and cannot ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, but a little water <hi>ſprinckled</hi> doth more aptly ſet forth the <hi>value, worth, and dignity</hi> of Chriſts blood, which is as it were freſhly running out of his veins, and <hi>beſprinckled</hi> upon the ſubject in Baptiſm.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Sprinckling</hi> of the water in baptiſm, doth hold a conformity unto, and preſerves the commemoration of, the legall <hi>ſprincklings,</hi> in the Old-Teſtament, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. compared with <hi>Hebrews</hi> the 9th. you will finde that <hi>Moſes,</hi> after he had preached and ſpoken the Law of God unto the people, he took the blood of calves, and of goats, &amp;c. and <hi>beſprinckled</hi> the book and all the people, the tabernacle, the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the miniſtry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all things were purged by the <hi>ſprinckling</hi> of blood. And the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> refers all to the purging and <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of the conſcience from dead works to ſerve the living God,</hi> Heb. 10.22 &amp; Heb. 12. ver. 24. <hi>You are come,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to the blood of Sprinckling, that speaketh better things than the blood of</hi> Abel; <hi>the blood of sprinckling,</hi> that is, the <hi>blood</hi> wherewith you are <hi>sprinckled,</hi> alluding to that blood of the Old-covenant, mentioned <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.20. So we are <hi>sprinckled</hi> with the blood of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is more lively repreſented in the <hi>sprinckling</hi> of water in baptiſm, then in <hi>dipping</hi> or dowſing the ſubject of baptiſm (ſo much inſiſted upon.)</p>
               <p n="4">4. This ceremony of <hi>sprinckling,</hi> or pouring out water, in baptiſm, doth more lively repreſent the performance of ſeverall promiſes of ſanctification unto the Gentiles, mentioned by the words <hi>sprinckling</hi> and <hi>pouring out</hi> of water, then that of <hi>dipping</hi> doth, Ezek. 36.25. <hi>I will sprinckle clean water upon you, and you ſhall be clean from all yuor filthineſs; and from all your Idolls will I clenſe you, and a new heart alſo will I give you,</hi> &amp;c. So again in Iſa. 52 23, 24, 25. it is propheſied of <hi>Chriſt, Behold my Servant ſhall deale prudently: he ſhall be exalted, and extolled, and be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he ſhall ſprinckle many Nations,</hi> &amp;c. So again Iſa. 44.3. <hi>I will poure out water upon</hi> him that is thirſty, &amp;c. <hi>I will poure out my Spirit.</hi> So again Joel 2.18. I <hi>will poure out my Spirit upon all Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>upon all Fleſh,</hi> as well as upon the Jews. Thus the ceremony of <hi>sprinckling,</hi> or of <hi>pouring out</hi> of water in baptiſm, doth help a mans faith in the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and expecting the performance of theſe promiſes, after a more effectuall manner, than <hi>dipping</hi> doth.</p>

<note place="margin">Sprinckling and pouring out wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of baptiſm, better anſwers the end of that Ordinance, than dipping the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of baptiſm, or burying him under water.</note> let us compare your <hi>dipping</hi> with your notions and apprehenſions thereof, together with ſprinckling, and our apprehenſion thereof: and then ſee which is moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be the truth, and to anſwer the nature of a Sacrament.</p>
               <p>We have uſually conſidered three things in Sacraments, the outward viſible ſign: The thing ſignified thereby; and the inward ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall grace. As to inſtance, in the Supper of the Lord, the Bread and Wine are the outward viſible ſigns: The Body and blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the things ſignified: Our ſpirituall Union with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> refreſhment by
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:192312:27"/>
                  <hi>Chriſt,</hi> intereſt in <hi>Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> theſe are the ſpirituall graces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So now conſider in our Notions and apprehenſions of baptiſm by <hi>sprinckling;</hi> The outward viſible ſign is, Water: the thing ſignified by it, is the Blood of Chriſt: The inward and ſpirituall graces, they are remiſſion of ſins, ſanctification, ſpirituall waſhing, clenſing our ſelves from all pollutions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (the ſpirituall graces of any Sacrament being very many and vatious.) Now let us conſider your Notion of Dipping intended by <hi>Chriſt</hi> (as you ſay) therein, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſhew forth <hi>the death, buriall, and reſurrection of Chriſt for ſinners, and the ſinners death unto ſin, ſuffering with Chriſt, Reſurrection to all newneſs of life here, and glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</hi> Let us then examine it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Here is water, the outward viſible ſign; What muſt this ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie? Or what is the thing ſignified by it? Is it to anſwer the <hi>Death and Buriall, and Reſurrection of Chriſt?</hi> What anſwers Water? Is it the death or blood of Chriſt? So far we grant alſo, that the Water ſignifieth Chriſts Blood. So far I believe you are right: and this doth more live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſent the Blood of Chriſt trickling, or ſprinckling down by drops and guſhes, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>sprinckling</hi> or <hi>pouring</hi> out of water, than <hi>dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi> into water. But to make it repreſent the <hi>buriall</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> how will you make the parallel? Let us try how things will agree.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here is water, whereinto the ſubject is dipped, or dowſed: this is the outward viſible ſign.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What is thereby ſignified? The Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> cannot be here the thing ſignified; for <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not buryed in his own blood, but in the earth. Then the thing ſignified hereby is the earth; and it can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, what ever be the inward and ſpirituall graces. Now I offer, Where do we ever find water in Scripture to repreſent the earth? It doth frequently ſign fie the Spirit, the blood of Chriſt, the pure word of God, whereby men are made clean, when they are polluted; refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed when thirſty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But never doth it ſignifie the Earth, as it muſt here according to your Notion of it, this being to ſhew forth <hi>the buriall of Chriſt.</hi> Is not this an earthly and dull interpretation, repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and expoſition of water in baptiſm, as you carry it?</p>
               <p>Again, to repreſent unto us the <hi>Reſurrection of Christ,</hi> you muſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage it thus. Firſt here is water, the outward visible Sign. 2. What muſt be ſignified thereby? It cannot be the <hi>blood of Christ.</hi> For as <hi>Christ</hi> was not <hi>buried</hi> in his own blood, ſo he did not <hi>riſe</hi> out of his own blood. That that muſt anſwer water here alſo, muſt be the earth again, out of which Chriſt roſe. Is not this a moſt fanſifull and unſcripturall uſe of the word Water? But you will object and ſay,</p>

For confirmation hereof, let us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the two Texts laſt quoted by you: Rom. 6.4, 5. <hi>VVe are buryed with him by Baptiſm, &amp;c.</hi> Colloſſ. 2.12. <hi>VVe are buryed with him in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, &amp;c.</hi> What is here againſt baptizing of children? what to juſtifie ſeparation from churches baptized only in their infancie? What is here to evince, that it is the expreſs command, will, and pleaſure of God, that baptiſm muſt be by the totall immerſion of the ſubject of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:192312:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>baptiſm, by <hi>burying</hi> and <hi>dipping</hi> him in the water? and that every other manner of baptizing is a nullity, and meer babiſm and vanity? Theſe Texts ſpeak of the bleſſed fruits, benefits, and conſequences of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, not of the <hi>manner</hi> of baptizing. All that they ſay is this, that in, or <hi>by Baptiſm</hi> (be the manner what it will) <hi>we are buryed with Chriſt,</hi> that is, we have a bleſſed fellowſhip with <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> in his <hi>death, bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi> and <hi>reſurrection;</hi> God making a bleſſed co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>enant with us, in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and we with him, that through the <hi>death, buriall, and reſurrection of Chriſt,</hi> he is become ours, and we are become his; that as he <hi>dyed,</hi> was <hi>buryed,</hi> and <hi>roſe</hi> again for us, ſo we would <hi>live,</hi> and <hi>dye</hi> with him unto the world, fleſh, and devill, and henceforth live as thoſe that were <hi>riſen</hi> again with Chriſt. Theſe Texts do not prove, firſt that <hi>dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi> or plunging in the waters of baptiſm, is the expreſs will of God concerning perſons when they are baptized, reſpecting the manner thereof: Nor ſecondly, that the perſons baptized in thoſe dayes, were ſo baptized; but it proves (as we have ſaid) that whatſoever the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their baptiſm was, that believers, by their baptiſm, are <hi>buryed with Chriſt,</hi> which is not at all denyed; the very deſign of the Apoſtle here, not being to ſet forth the manner of baptiſm, but the benefits and fruits thereof. When the Apoſtle ſaith in the next verſe,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.5.</note> 
                  <hi>if we have been planted together in the likeneſs of his death, we ſhall, &amp;c.</hi> this doth not ſhew the manner of <hi>Chriſts</hi> death, as whether he was killed with a Sword, ſtrangled, or crucified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but ſome other thing: if you will know the manner of Chriſt death, you muſt look elſewhere for it. So again, when the Apoſtle ſaith in the 3. to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> and the 3. ver. <hi>we are the circume ſion, &amp;c.</hi> this doth not prove the <hi>manner</hi> of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, but another thing: circumciſion might be the cutting off of ſomething from the fore-head, or finger, or any other part, for all that can be gathered from that Text, you muſt ſearch elſewhere for that. Even ſo when the Apoſtle ſaith, we are <hi>buryed with Chriſt, in,</hi> or <hi>by,</hi> Baptiſm, if you will look for the expreſs will and command of God, concerning the <hi>manner</hi> of baptiſm, you muſt find it elſwhere, and not in this place.</p>
               <p>And further,
<note place="margin">Tho it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the practiſe of baptiſmin the primitive times was by dipping; yet will it not follow that dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping is binding upon all perſons in all places.</note> though it ſhould be granted (as poſſibly it may be true) that perſons baptized at that time, and in thoſe parts of the world, where (it is likely) it might be done without danger to their health, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were baptized by <hi>dowſing, dipping,</hi> or <hi>plunging</hi> into the water, and that the Apoſtle might take advantage from the <hi>manner</hi> thereof, namely, the more ſignificantly and emphatically to put them in mind of their being dead and buryed with Chriſt, that is, of their being in the State of death, and of buriall, as they were when under the water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it doth not prove that therefore they ought to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized no other way. For though they were baptized after that manner, yet they might have been baptized after another manner without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence unto God, if ſo be they were not tyed up and reſtrained by God unto that manner, and from all other; ſhew us where is ſuch reſtraint in the Scripture. If from thoſe Texts you will prove the neceſſity of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:192312:30"/>the <hi>manner</hi> of baptiſm to be by immerſion, becauſe the Text ſaith, <hi>we are buryed: with him in baptiſm;</hi> that is, as Chriſt was <hi>buryed</hi> in, or under, the earth, ſo we were <hi>buryed</hi> in and under the waters, inferring as well the manner of <hi>Chriſts buryall,</hi> as the manner of our <hi>baptiſm,</hi> why may you not infer thence alſo the manner of Chriſts death, as well as of his <hi>buryall?</hi> and with what kind of art can you make the analogy to hold there? The next words ſpeak of our being <hi>planted together in the likeneſs of his death,</hi> &amp;c. Is there any thing in <hi>dipping</hi> ſetting forth the manner of <hi>Chriſts</hi> death? Well, though it be granted that ſome were (nay, that all ſpoken of in the Scripture were dipt in baptiſme) yet will it not follow, that if they had been baptized any other way, they had offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their Leige Lord, except he had denyed them their liberty in this caſe, and commanded them to be baptized in that manner only, and no other way.</p>
               <p>If we ſeriouſly conſider the Texts by you urged, to prove the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of <hi>dipping, viz. Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Coll.</hi> 2.12. they intend to teach men the true, and moſt neceſſary Doctrine, and uſe of baptiſm, not the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thereof. The Doctrine, Benefits, and uſe of Baptiſm, theſe are plainly taught us in the Scriptures, which (indeed) we ſhould more ſtudy and practiſe, than thus diſingeniouſly to ſeparate, rend, and run away from the bleſſed aſſemblies of the Saints and Churches of God, becauſe they differ in theſe externall things. And the truth is, there being (at leaſt that we can finde) no one determinate and externall manner of baptiſm, or uſing the water in baptiſm, eſſentiall thereunto by Gods command; that therefore we ought to <hi>ſtand faſt in that liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free, and not be intangled with any yoake of bondage</hi> impoſed upon us by man, as you ſeem to impoſe this of <hi>dipping</hi> upon your brethren, having only ſuch thin, wateriſh, and ſlender Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and Proofs for the ſame.

                  <hi>Thomas Goodwin</hi> (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid) the ſaid Mr. <hi>Thomas Goodwin</hi> was in <hi>Holland</hi> (as your ſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve) at which indeed Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> was offended; namely that the holy, learned, and good men of thoſe times, ſuch as Mr. <hi>Thomas Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi> and others were, ſhould break away out of the Nation, taking with them the hewen-ſtones of Gods Temples, as you know many went away into ſeverall parts of <hi>America,</hi> ſome to the Summer-Iſlands, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to <hi>Holland</hi> and the low-Countries; at which the Biſhops were wel pleaſed, as not doubting but they might (with more eaſe) deal with the remnant that were left behind. Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> did often bewaile the departure of thoſe men, and reſolved by Gods grace to ſtand it out againſt all the adverſaries of Gods people in thoſe times. And you know he did perſiſt in his reſolutions and integrity, even to the making of himſelf a by-word and a mock amongſt them; <hi>viz.</hi> then when others were fled and run away, Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> was left to pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> At this, chiefly, and mainly, was Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> offended with Mr. <hi>Thomas Goodwin.</hi> Never was he troubled at the joyning together of holy men in any pariſh, to keep out the vitious and evil party, according to their beſt opportunities ſo to do. Neither did he ever refuſe (that ever I have heard) the entertainment of godly perſons (though not of the pariſh) into Church communion with him, that did defire the ſame. Nay ſeverall perſons living in ſeverall parts of the City out of the pariſh, were his moſt intimate aſſociates even in the ordinances of Gods worſhip and ſervice, and in all things relating to reformation, though in that pariſh (the civill intereſt of the pariſh only excepted.)</p>
               <p n="3">3.

I remember well it was demanded by the brethren that diffented from Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> ſeverall times, whether
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:192312:37"/>Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> and the brethren that joyned with him, would deny, that they were a true Church, before theſe differences did ariſe amongſt them: and it was never denyed, but that they were a true Church, though under much deformity, and want of Reformation. At laſt it was aſſented unto, that an equall number of perſons, choſen by M. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> on the one party, and the diſſenting brethren on the other party, ſhould meet, and agree, who, how many, and what manner of perſons (not living in the Pariſh) ſhould be admitted into Church-fellow-ſhip with them. And after all things in a publick-meeting in the Pariſh Church, or meeting place, were compoſed by Vote, and a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, peaceable, and comfortable reformation was expected, the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren formerly diſſenting from M. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> receded from their former agreements, rent themſelves away from M. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> leaving him and a conſiderable part alſo of the godly party in the pariſh with him, to go alone in their Church-Reformation.</p>

But M. <hi>VVhitaker</hi> upon the full underſtanding of the whole matter, would not accept of the ſame: By all which it appears to all impartiall men, that ever underſtood the Hiſtory of theſe tranſactions, that it was not M. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> and thoſe of the Pariſh that joyned with him in that reformation, who ſeparated from the godly <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> as you call them, but that they were the true ſeparatiſts, though they would be known by another name. And God almighty pardon them, and lay not their ſeparation unto their charge, &amp; ſhew you mercy alſo for your groundleſs ſeparation from us, and for your untrue charging <hi>M.

               <p n="4">4. Suppoſe M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> had altogether been now of another opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion about Church-work, then he was before, when he wrote that

It may (indeed) and I think it ought, to keep him from cenſuring you, as ſinning againſt your light and conſcience, as ſuppoſing your heart right with God in reſpect of your intentions in your ſeparations: and ſo it doth. For where hath he cenſured you, or the reſt of the brethren walking with you, as ſo ſinning? I believe he hath exerciſed more charity to you-ward in this kinde, than you have towards him: and it is fit he ſhould, for he hath more to exerciſe. But doth this wholly excuſe you, or reflect diſhonour upon <hi>M. Goodwin</hi> for condemning your ſeparation? Suppoſe you had turn'd <hi>Papiſts, Iews, Turks</hi> in your very judgement and conſciences, or (as many) Ranters and licentious perſons, and ſtill by the deluſion of your judgements and conſciences; would it have been diſhonourable for M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> to write againſt you, becauſe M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> turned ſeparate from the Church of England?

               <p>I Reply:
<note place="margin">The ſolemn league &amp; cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for ſeparation.</note> Firſt, to that of the Covenant, that it was in the very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of it, a covenant of <hi>union,</hi> and not of <hi>diviſion,</hi> of the godly party <hi>in the three nations;</hi> that it was intended by the framers, and impoſers thereof, that each perſon <hi>ſhould</hi> be an example unto his brother, <hi>going one before another</hi> in known wayes of <hi>joynt</hi> Reformation; that in things granted by the generality of the godly party, to be the mind and will of God, each ſhould provoke his brother unto reformation, not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hereby, a <hi>liberty,</hi> much leſs a <hi>duty</hi> vowed, and covenanted, <hi>viz.</hi> that in caſe of different apprehenſions, eſpecially in ſmaller matters, or ceremonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> each ſhould be obliged to run away from his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting brother. If ſo be that in doubtfull, and queſtionable things, ſuch as your notions of infant-baptiſm, and rebaptization, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:192312:39"/>each ſhould be bound by this vow and covenant, to follow his own perſonall conception; where ſhould two believers be found walking together? And is the nationall vow and covenant, which intended to make all the <hi>people of God in the three nations to be one,</hi> a ſufficient ground to render believers, as ſo many wandring <hi>Cains,</hi> to run away one from another? what, to joyn together as beacons upon hills do?

                  <note place="margin">Conceit of light notformerly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, no plea for ſeparation.</note> we have already anſwered, Sect. 6. and elſewhere.

               <p>TO this you anſwer: Firſt, by abſolute denyall of the ſaid conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and affirm it <hi>a miſtake,</hi> that ſuch Churches, not actually baptized with your baptiſm, ſhould (the premiſes notwithſtanding) <hi>be eſteemed by God to have been baptized,</hi> offering onely, that that Text, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. doth not prove, that God judgeth a man <hi>actually</hi> and in a formal <hi>proper ſenſe</hi> to have been baptized, who never was thus baptized; or that the deed is done, when there is no ſuch deed done, but only a will to do it.</p>
               <p>I Reply. That to inſiſt upon this, is but to ſuſpect the reader a very infant in underſtanding, for doth the conſideration it ſelf, in the very leaſt, imply, that God judgeth that <hi>actually and in a formal proper ſenſe</hi> to be done, which was never done? nay doth it not more then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that it is only <hi>accepted</hi> in reſpect of reward, as done, <hi>though not done?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">God accepteth the will for the deed.</note> Is this diſtinction of the <hi>will</hi> from the <hi>deed,</hi> and Gods <hi>acceptance</hi> of the <hi>will</hi> for the <hi>deed,</hi> as done, though it be never done, <hi>a perfect chaos and confuſion</hi> unto you? Doth M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſay that God judgeth that <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and in a formal proper ſenſe</hi> to be done, which was never done? Doth he not ſpeak only of <hi>acceptance,</hi> as if done? And is this ſo Aenigmatical and hard a ſaying to your underſtanding? If this conſideration given
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:192312:40"/>by M. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> ſhould not import a truth, what hopes could you and I have of ſalvation? Doth not God <hi>accept</hi> of our faith, putting us upon a holy endeavour to keep all his commandments, (though we keep none, but <hi>in many things ſin all</hi>) as if we did <hi>actually and formally keep them</hi> all, and break none? Do you expect at the great day, to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by <hi>weight,</hi> or by <hi>will?</hi> Is it the <hi>willingneſs</hi> of your minde, or the <hi>worthineſs</hi> of your works, that is the Ancor of your ſoul in the day of Chriſt?

               <p n="2">2. Though God accepteth a deſire of obedience (though obedience be not performed for want of knowledge of Gods minde therein) yet this doth not excuſe mens ignorance. God doth not <hi>juſtifie men in any ſuch</hi> falſe <hi>judgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I reply. And is this an anſwer? may not we infer; therefore God doth not juſtifie your <hi>ignorance of his minde,</hi> in keeping covenant with him and his Church and people, though differing in ſome things from you, but breaking the ſame as a thred of Tow.

                  <hi>The Scriptures expreſly teach, that by faith men become the children of Abraham, and ſons of God, Iohn</hi> 1.12. <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11, 12.16. <hi>thoſe then that are not their brethren, are baſtards and not ſons.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:192312:40"/>whom Chriſt is not aſhamed,</hi> Heb. 2.11. It follows then, that Chriſt muſt look upon them as having a conceit, that they have either more holyneſs, or dignity, than Chriſt himſelf, in that they are aſhamed of thoſe, of whom Chriſt is not aſhamed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>To this you anſwer, by granting the truth of the conſideration, but offer, that no mans faith was accepted with God in the premitive times, who was found ſticking at any of his commandments. Now baptiſme being the expreſs command of Chriſt, you inſinuate no man muſt be owned by you as Brethren, that ſtict at it, as we do. If this be not your inſinuation you ſay nothing, but grant all that M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> affirms, and your ſelf to be convicted of diſowning <hi>Christs</hi> brethren, as aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of them: if this be your ſenſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. I Reply, That you have owned us for <hi>holy brethren,
<note place="margin">Mr. Lamb owns thoſe for holy brethren, belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, a Church, and yet ſeparates from them.</note> as walking in the right faith of the goſpell,</hi> as <hi>beloved of God,</hi> therefore you are condemned by your own mouth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You inſinuate that <hi>we ſtick at the commands of Chriſt,</hi> which is an uncharitable and ſcandalous inſinuation. We dare not receive your weak and ſhallow interpretation of Scripture, for the commands of Chriſt; you muſt prove it the command of Chriſt, that perſons bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in their infancie, muſt be baptized again; that childrens baptiſm is forbidden in Scripture, or a nullity: you may ſooner be able to ſhew us one of the feathers of the Raven that fed <hi>Elias,</hi> than ſhew us any ſuch thing, and yet you boaſt that you have the expreſs will of God, the plain word of Chriſt, the command of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the ſame you take your dead and unſound interpretation of Scripture,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 3.20.</note> as the Harlot her dead child, and caſt it in the boſome of the holy Scriptures, and this you would enforce upon us, as the off-ſpring of Gods word, and after a moſt proud and popiſh manner, you exalt your interpretation as equipolent with the Text, and the rejection thereof by thoſe that differ from you, is the rejection of the <hi>command of Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>ſticking</hi> at it, is to <hi>stick at the command of God,</hi> exalting your interpretation of the Scriptures, above, beyond, or beſides all that is called Gods, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king perverſe, or diſtorted things, to diſcerp, or violently drag Diſciples after you, and indeed, bringing your ſenſe to the Scriptures, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it cheek-by-jowle with the Scriptures, and not receiving it from the Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Do you make no difference between <hi>ſticking</hi> (as you call it) at a known duty, and at a doubtful practiſe? did not you once <hi>ſtick at it</hi> your ſelf as we do? and had the perſon done you no wrong that ſhould then affirm that you never gave any viſible teſtimony or fruit of your faith, until you were newly baptized?</p>
               <p>From the 9th Page of your book, ſpeaking to M. <hi>Goodwins</hi> third conſideration, you take an excurſion, even unto the 32. Page, quite forſaking the buſineſs in hand, and repeating M. <hi>Allens</hi> Arguments
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:192312:41"/>about baptiſm, which have been anſwered once, and again, by Mr. <hi>Goodwin;</hi> and to run after you, is to perſue the wind, which will bring nothing but vanity in the latter end.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> fourth Conſideration runs thus, <hi>ſuch perſons whom God judgeth fit for communion with himſelf, upon grounds viſible unto men, ought not to be judged unmeet for communion with the holyeſt of men, Rom.</hi> 14.1, 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17, 18. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.7. that you therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg us to have worth, yea more worth, holineſs, righteouſneſs, the fear and love of God in us, than many among your ſelves, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed after your own minds have; and ſeparating from us, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving us into fellowſhip with you in Church-communions, do ſin contrary to the truth of this conſideration.</p>
               <p>To this you ſay, (1) The perſons to whom the Apoſtle wrote, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. were baptized. (2) That by the word, <hi>receiving,</hi> is not meant into Church-fellowſhip, but into common reſpect, and brotherly familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. (3.) That though it ſhould be to receive them into Church-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, it doth not follow that they ſhould be <hi>diſorderly</hi> received. (4.) Upon this ground, godly Presbyterians, godly Epiſcopal men, godly Papiſts, nay honeſt Heathens, ſhould be admitted into Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communion. (5.) That it is contrary to Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> own practiſe, and having here gotten, as you ſuppoſe, Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> under your feer, you flouriſh your naked ſword, as if the trophies of victory muſt make halt to your temples, for you ſay, <hi>who then may not ſee, &amp;c.</hi> but hold a little.</p>

If the Apoſtle would have them to <hi>receive</hi> them into common reſpect, they being already in Church-fellowſhip, then would not he have any diſ-reſpect at all in any kind, cither common, or ſpecial, upon the account of their different

               </p>
               <p>I reply: If Scruple had been about the order or manner of their reception, ſome being <hi>weak in the faith hereabout,</hi> if <hi>God hath accepted them,</hi> except you will put them upon new terms, which God never did, and be wiſe above what is written, <hi>receive them,</hi> for the reaſon you ſee is, <hi>for God hath accepted them.</hi> You go on.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I reply: If a Presbyterian, a prelaticall man, a Papiſt, nay a heathen can give a viſible teſtimony of <hi>his communion and fellowſhip with God,</hi> and that <hi>God hath accepted him,</hi> though he ſhould ſcruple the manner of baptiſm, and ſeverall circumſtances therein, and ſhould make his application unto us, giving ſufficient teſtimony <hi>that God hath accepted</hi> him, and he promiſing to walk as a viſible believer, in all the good wayes of God, (what ever your principle is) I am not aſhamed to tel you that my opinion is, that he ſhould be <hi>received</hi> into Church-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with us, and make no ſcruple of entertaining thoſe that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Holy Ghoſt, as well as we.

I have read of one <hi>Orietes,</hi> that imagined that he did ſee his own ſhape and picture ſtil going before him; So it ſeems in thoſe pathes of the Scripture where you walk, you ſuppoſe you ſee the ſhadow of your opinion about bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, yea the truth (in that) <hi>ſhining with the majeſty of God.</hi> You argue (with the Scriptures) as the Papiſts (your great pattern in the mount, in more things than in this) do, to prove their fanatick notions and practiſes.

               <p>I hope now it appears clearer than the Sun, (if clearer may be) that <hi>in Pauls judgement</hi> godly and holy perſons (though one with Chriſt Jeſus by faith) that ſcruple baptiſm, and are not baptized after our way and manner, have no more right to Church-memberſhip than thoſe that are one in communion and fellowſhip, even with the Devill himſelf, or elſe <hi>Paul</hi> would <hi>pull down with his one hand, what he built up with another.</hi>

If you will anſwer the argument of the conſideration in hand, you muſt prove the command of Chriſt, Mat. 28.19. <hi>Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c. was a Law impoſed upon you (if you wil take upon you to baptize others) as well as upon the Apoſtles; As alſo, who are thoſe mentioned in <hi>baptizing them,</hi> what is the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, or ſubſtantive, to this relative pronoun, <hi>them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, you muſt prove that the Apoſtles did teach believers to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire baptiſm of them, and that Chriſt did command his Apoſtles to teach the Nations to obſerve it; and that the Apoſtles in their miniſtry did teach churches, or perſons, to ſeek baptiſm at their hands, much leſs to threaten them for not ſeeking it.</p>
               <p>Again, you muſt prove, if you will ſpeak to the conſideration, or that under conſideration, that the Apoſtles had power, by vertue of their commiſſion, to make it a ſtanding Law, for all Paſtors and Teachers who were to ſucceed them in the miniſtry, to impoſe the obſervation of the ſame law upon all believers, and the rather, becauſe (1.) water baptiſm ſeems (by the practiſe of the Apoſtles) to be intended by God <hi>chiefly,</hi> if not only for to attend the Goſpel in its firſt reception by a people. (2.) In that where the work or office of Paſtors and Teachers, or their qualifications are deſcribed, there is no mention made of any charge upon them to baptize, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, if you conſider the conſideration, you muſt prove that thoſe words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>and ſo</hi> I <hi>am with you to the end of the world,</hi> do neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily imply, that baptiſm is to continue <hi>unto the end of the world;</hi> for as much as the phraſe <hi>to the end of the world,</hi> may mean (1.) His being with them unto the end of their lives. (2.) That their labours ſhould proſper and be fruitfull (when they were dead, and gone) even <hi>to the end of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, you muſt prove the promiſe of his preſence, not only to his Apoſtles and ſucceſſors in the adminiſtration of baptiſm <hi>unto the end of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:192312:46"/>the world;</hi> but that the like promiſe is made unto private Chriſtians alſo, in their adminiſtrations of baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Theſe things are propounded (as Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſaith) not as inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to argue the extinction of the Ordinance of baptiſm, but rather as a demonſtration of the many Labyrinths and Difficulties, which you ought to overcome and clear, who are ſo confidently poſitive and aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of your practiſe, and who pronounce all men unworthy of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an-communion, who are not as poſitive and aſſertive as your ſelves.

               <p>Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> 20. Conſideration, is to this purpoſe:</p>
               <p>Peter <hi>being questioned for holding communion with</hi> Cornelius, <hi>and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gentiles, by the brethren of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>he juſtifieth it, by telling them, that they having received the Holy Ghoſt as wel as themſelves, they had no Reaſon to reject them, never making the leaſt mention of their being baptized, and with that account only the brethren were ſatisfied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this you anſwer, 1. <hi>They were baptized.</hi> I reply, How could the brethren know that? 2. You ſay <hi>the communion</hi> Peter <hi>had with them, was after baptiſm.</hi> I reply, How could the brethren know that ſtill? the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtill is, why did not <hi>Peter</hi> inform them of their baptiſm? 1. You an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>the Scriptures ſilence doth not argue that there was no mention made of it.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>In thoſe dayes a believing perſon, and a baptized perſon, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the ſame.</hi> I reply, 1.

The contrary is palpable; for, (1.) there were believers before they were baptized, and therefore were ſo preſumed to be their faith and the profeſſion thereof, being praevious to their baptiſm. (2.) there were many believers ſpoken of by the Scriptures, of whoſe baptiſm there is not the leaſt mention made, <hi>viz.</hi> of the baptiſm of <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn, Philip,</hi> and <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p n="1">1.

            </p>
            <p>M. <hi>Goodwins</hi> words out of the 335. page of his <hi>Redemption-Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi> ſpeaking againſt the aſſurance of the love of God, to a perſon <hi>outragiouſly and deſperately wicked and prophane,</hi> theſe are his very words,</p>
            <q>
               <hi>I verily believe, that in caſe any</hi> ſuch <hi>aſſurance of the unchangeableneſs of Gods love were to be found in, or could regularly be deduced from the Scriptures, it were a iuſt ground to any intelligent and conſidering man, to queſtion their authority, and whether they were from God or no.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>The ſix Book ſellers to render <hi>M. Goodwin</hi> an Heretick, tranſcribed his words out of the ſame place, affirming that <hi>M. Goodwin</hi> ſaid thus:</p>
            <q>
               <hi>That in caſe any aſſurance of the unchangeableneſs of Gods love, were to be found in, or regularly be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the Scriptures, it were a iuſt ground to any intelligent man to queſtion their authority, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were from God or no.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Would not a man think that theſe ſix Book ſellers were all brethren of the linage of one of thoſe two falſe witneſſes againſt Chriſt, <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.58. who affirmed that they heard him ſay, <hi>I will destroy this Temple that is made with hands, and within three dayes I will build up another made without hands,</hi> which was neither his ſaying, nor meaning; his ſaying was, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.19. <hi>destroy ye;</hi> they affirm that he ſaid, <hi>I will destroy:</hi> his ſaying was, <hi>this Temple;</hi> they affirm he ſaid, <hi>this Temple made with hands,</hi> &amp;c. If theſe Book-ſellers ſhould thus prevaricate with thoſe with whom they trade, about mens eſtates, as they have with <hi>M. Goodwin</hi> in matters relating to his good name, would any wiſe men deal with them for three pence: Certain I am, however they may flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and may have pillows under their Elbows; and men (known by the name of the Prophets of God too) may ſpeak peace to them for their pretended zeal for the truth of God, and againſt errors, yet the Holy Scriptures yeilds no hopes, much leſs aſſurance, of ſalvation unto ſuch perſons, living and dying in ſuch wilfull abuſe of men without repentance; and <hi>M. Lamb</hi> chargeth this curſed delinquencie upon <hi>M. Goodwin,</hi> dealing with <hi>M. Allen</hi> as theſe ſix Book-ſellers did with him: But let us examine whether this be ſo or no. <hi>M. Allens</hi> words (as

            <p>
               <hi>M. Goodwin</hi> dealing with thoſe words by way of anſwer, in the 64. page of his <hi>VVater-Dipping,</hi> &amp;c. tranſcribes them thus:</p>
            <q>
               <hi>If one perſon ſhould be admitted upon ſuch terms</hi> (that is as you explain it, without baptiſm) <hi>then why not two? if two, why not ten, and ſo an hundred, or a thouſand; and conſequently</hi> ſuch <hi>Goſpel order laid totally aſide.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>What injury hath <hi>M. Goodwin</hi> done here to <hi>M. Allen</hi> in the tranſcribing his words: Hath he dealt with him as the ſix Book-ſellers dealt with <hi>M.
